## Chatbox

Chatbox is a peer-to-peer chatbox Python application provides users with a platform to connect, communicate, and collaborate with their friends and other users in real-time, leveraging the power of Python sockets and threading for seamless interaction. A user first enters their userID or creates an account using a username and is given a userID. 

### To run:
1. Start the server by entering this command prompt: python3 server.py
2. Clients enter this command prompt: python3 client.py
3. Clients are instructed different command prompts to add a friend, communicate, and see who's active as shown in the images below.
